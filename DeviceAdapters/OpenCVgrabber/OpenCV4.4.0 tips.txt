4) download and run cmake GUI, set source code folder to "...opencv\source" and build to "...opencv\build", select configuration to start build
5) after build, click generate to generate lib and dll

     c) Linker\Input\Additional Dependencies:opencv_core440.lib;opencv_highgui440.lib;opencv_imgproc440.lib;
8) Copy 3rdpartypublic\opencv\build\bin\Release\...dlls to MM installation directory.
